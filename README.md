# Ideas
Want to create something for the JCR? Want to suggest ideas for projects? If so, send a Pull Request to add more ideas!
Along with the idea, please explain roughly what the system should do, with information about the problem that it solves (otherwise, just mention it being a cool idea, as that wins a lot of arguments around here). Not sure about your idea? Add it anyway, as it'll be fun :) 

## Karaoke System
For Aidan's run karaoke events, we typically used an online website as our karaoke system. This website however is completely filled with ads. The idea is to create our own karaoke system, that uses some sort of music supplier (suggestion: concatenate the search query with the word 'karaoke'), to find karaoke songs, based on some generic search term (e.g song name, artist, album)

## Aidan's Dashboard App
Rather than people going onto the JCR site, navigating to the current students section, why don't we create some form of native app for people to use? It could contain information about servery menus (loaded from the website using the Wagtail API), formals booking, room booking, all using REST APIs. It might be an idea to use a framework like React Native/Cordova, because you can write once, and use for each platform. Writing an Android version in Java/Kotlin, and another iOS version in Swift/Objective C is also perfectly fine though :)
